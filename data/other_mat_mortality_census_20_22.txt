Caveats:
"1. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated."
"2. The population figures for years 2021 and later are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, based on the"
"Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count, from the Vintage 2021"
"postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 30, 2022. The population figures for year 2020 are single-race estimates"
"of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2020 postcensal series based on April 2010 Census, released by the Census"
"Bureau on July 27, 2021. The population figures for year 2019 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from"
"the Vintage 2019 postcensal series based on April 2010 Census, released by the Census Bureau on June 25, 2020. The population"

"3. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Deaths with the underlying cause classified with O00-O99 are"
"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
"processing and review and therefore should not be considered final for statistical purposes. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"4. Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information:"
