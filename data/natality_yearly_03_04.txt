Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"2. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for"
"age, race, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set mother's age selecting some years"
"not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included in the denominator population. If"
"you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, the denominator population returned will be zero and"
"flagged ""Not Available""."
"3. Birth rates and fertility rates for years 2003-2006 are calculated using the revised intercensal bridged-race series of July"
