Caveats:
"1. 'Suppressed' appears instead of fetal deaths and percent of total values when the death value represents 0-9 sub-national"
"events. This is because the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"

"2. For some fields the data are recoded to ""Not Reported"" for specific states and years. The records are recoded because fetal"
"deaths to mothers residing in a reporting area continued to use the 1989 U.S. Standard Report of Fetal Death, or fetal deaths to"
"mothers residing in a reporting area that used the 2003 U.S. Standard Report of Fetal Death had more than 50% of fetal deaths"
"assigned to unknown or unspecified cause (P95) in the specified year, or the state simply did not report item for some years."
