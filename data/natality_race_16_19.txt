Caveats:
"1. 'Not Available' appears when the denominator population for a rate measure is not available."
"2. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"3. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then"
"the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set"
"mother's age selecting some years not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included"
"in the denominator population. If you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, ""Not Available"" is"
"reported for the denominator population. Single race categories are not available for births before year 2016. Bridged race"
"categories are not available for births after year 2019."
"4. Single Race categories are not available for births before year 2016. Maternal single race data for years before 2016 are"
"recoded to the Single Race category ""Not Available"". More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#About-Single-Race."
"5. Rates returned for Hispanicity in combination with either Bridged Race or Single Race are calculated differently here than in"
"other natality published reports. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#About-Rates."
