Caveats:
"1. Beginning in 2014, NCHS changed the standard for gestational period from the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) based gestational"
"age to the Obstetric/clinical Estimate (OE) based gestational age. This change has resulted in a discontinuity in identifying"
"fetal deaths at 20 weeks or greater for inclusion in this dataset. Refer to the User Guide to the Fetal Death Public Use File:"
