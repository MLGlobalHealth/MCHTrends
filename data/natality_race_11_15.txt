Caveats:
"1. 'Not Available' appears when the denominator population for a rate measure is not available."
"2. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"3. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then"
"the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set"
"mother's age selecting some years not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included"
"in the denominator population. If you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, ""Not Available"" is"
"reported for the denominator population. Single race categories are not available for births before year 2016. Bridged race"
"categories are not available for births after year 2019."
"4. Rates returned for Hispanicity in combination with either Bridged Race or Single Race are calculated differently here than in"
"other natality published reports. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#About-Rates."
"5. Beginning with 2020, bridged race categories are no longer included in the national birth file. Beginning with year 2021,"
"bridged race population estimates are not available as rate denominators."
"6. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following populations: The populations for year 2021 are from the"
"postcensal single race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on June 30, 2022. The"
