Caveats:
"1. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of"
"death code R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality."" Caution should be used in interpreting these data."

"2. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes,"
"most notably R95, ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"" and X40-X49, ""Unintentional poisoning."" Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#New-Jersey-Reporting-Anomalies."
"3. Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, ""Other"

"4. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"

"5. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"6. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
