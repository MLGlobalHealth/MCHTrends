# Data Sources

All data are publicly available to download from CDC WONDER (https://wonder.cdc.gov). 

Maternal deaths data are extracted from the Provisional Mortality Statistics table, available for 2018-2021. Fetal deaths data are extracted from the Fetal Deaths table, available for 2005-2021. Natality data (to index deaths by live births) are extracted from two Natality datasets: 2003-2006 and 2007-2021. 

The death counts are aggregated by year, age, race and state (separately).

Fetal deaths data can be accessed at the following links:
- National by year: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D133/D347F113
- National by mother's age: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D133/D347F112
- National by mother's race: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D133/D347F115
- By state: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D133/D347F116

Maternal deaths data can be accessed at the following links:
- National by year: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F305
- National by mother's age: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F148
- National by mother's race: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F151
- By state: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F150

The maternal deaths table is generated by limiting the mortality statistics tables to women aged 15-44 with the following ICD-10 codes as the underlying cause of death: A34, O00-O95 and O98-O99. This follows the definition for maternal mortality (death while pregnant or within 42 days of end of pregnancy), rather than wider definitions like pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-related death.
