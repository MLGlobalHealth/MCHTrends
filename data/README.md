# Data Sources

All data are publicly available to download from CDC WONDER (https://wonder.cdc.gov). Data used in this study are provided in the `cdc_wonder_links.txt` file.

Maternal deaths data are extracted from the Provisional Mortality Statistics tables, available for 1999-2023. Fetal deaths data are extracted from the Fetal Deaths table, available for 2005-2023. Natality data (to index deaths by live births) are extracted from three Natality datasets covering 1995-2023. 

The death counts are aggregated (separately or in combination) by year, age, racial/ethnic group, state and census region.

## Maternal Mortality
Maternal deaths data are generated by limiting the mortality statistics tables to women aged 15-44 with the following ICD-10 codes as the underlying cause of death: A34, O00-O95 and O98-O99. This follows the definition for maternal mortality (death while pregnant or within 42 days of end of pregnancy), rather than wider definitions like pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-related death.

By year:

- 2023 (Jan to June): https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D374F160

---
## Pregnancy-related Mortality
Pregnancy-related deaths (43-365 days after birth) data are generated by limiting the mortality statistics tables to women aged 15-44 with the following ICD-10 codes as the underlying cause of death: O96, O97. This includes deaths from any obstetrics cause 43-365 days after giving birth. 

By year:
