# Data Sources

All data are publicly available to download from CDC WONDER (https://wonder.cdc.gov). 

Maternal deaths data are extracted from the Provisional Mortality Statistics tables, available for 1999-2022. Fetal deaths data are extracted from the Fetal Deaths table, available for 2005-2021. Natality data (to index deaths by live births) are extracted from three Natality datasets covering 1995-2021. 

The death counts are aggregated by year, age, racial/ethnic group and state (separately).

Maternal deaths data can be accessed at the following links:
- National by year (2003-2017):
https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D77/D349F779 
- National by year (2018-2022): https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F305
- National by mother's age: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F148
- National by mother's racial/ethnic group: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F151
- By state: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F150

Maternal deaths data are generated by limiting the mortality statistics tables to women aged 15-44 with the following ICD-10 codes as the underlying cause of death: A34, O00-O95 and O98-O99. This follows the definition for maternal mortality (death while pregnant or within 42 days of end of pregnancy), rather than wider definitions like pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-related death.

Pregnancy-related deaths (43-365 days after birth) data can be found at the following links: 
- National by year (2003-2017): https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D77/D349F778

- National by mother's age: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F310
- National by mother's racial/ethnic group: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F313
- By state: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D347F312

Pregnancy-related deaths (43-365 days after birth) data are generated by limiting the mortality statistics tables to women aged 15-44 with the following ICD-10 codes as the underlying cause of death: O96. This includes deaths from any obstetrics cause 43-365 days after giving birth.

The pregnancy-related deaths tables are generated by limiting the mortality statistics tables to women aged 15-44. 

We also examine maternal mortality excluding the "other maternal/pregnancy-related causes" categories (ICD-10 codes O26.8 & O99) and specifically trends in those categories:

- Maternal mortality excl. other (2003-2017): https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D77/D349F782
- Maternal mortality excl. other (2018-2021): https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D349F775
- O26.8 & O99 (2003-2017): https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D77/D349F783
- O26.8 & O99 (2018-2021): https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D349F768

These are also limited to women aged 15-44.
